Liferay Chat Room is multi-channel discussion application for Liferay DXP or 7.

The implementation uses WebSocket and a JSON-RPC protocol I developed couple of years ago as part of my project [Palabre messenger](https://github.com/darrylsite/palabre-messenger)

The live version version of the portlet is testable on WeDeploy: [Liferay Chat Room](https://hack-nabster7.wedeploy.io/)
